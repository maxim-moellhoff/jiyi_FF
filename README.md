## Card Types

* **Read:** Character recognition and meaning.
* **Recall:** Active production from imagery/definitions.
* **Listen:** Auditory comprehension.
* **Write:** Handwriting and stroke order practice.

## Setup

1. Create a new **Note Type** in Anki.
2. Create four **Card Types**: Read, Recall, Listen, and Write.
3. For each card, paste the corresponding `front.html` and `back.html` from the `templates/` folders.
4. Copy the content of `templates/shared/styling.css` into the **Styling** section (this CSS is shared across all types).
